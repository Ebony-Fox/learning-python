In this exercise, we are going to learn about math operations that can be performed in Python and the name of each operation.

```python
- + : Plus
- - : Minus
- / : Slash
- * : Asterisk
- % : Percent
- < : Less-than
- > : Greater-than
- <= : Less-than-equal
- >= : Greater-than-equal
```

## Study Drills

```python
1. Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.

# Print the string "I will now count my chickens:"
print("I will now count my chickens:")

# Print the string "Hens" followed by the result of the arithmetic expression (25 + 30 / 6)
print("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6)

# Print the string "Roosters" followed by the result of the arithmetic expression (100 - 25 * 3 % 4)
print("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4)

# Print the string "Now I will count the eggs:"
print("Now I will count the eggs:")

# Perform the arithmetic expression and print the result (3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)
print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)

# Print the string "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"
print("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?")

# Perform the comparison (3 + 2 < 5 - 7) and print the result (True or False)
print(3 + 2 < 5 - 7)

# Print the string "What is 3 + 2?" followed by the result of the arithmetic expression (3 + 2)
print("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2)

# Print the string "What is 5 - 7?" followed by the result of the arithmetic expression (5 - 7)
print("What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7)

# Print the string "Oh, that's why it's False."
print("Oh, that's why it's False.")

# Print the string "How about some more."

print("How about some more.")

#Print the string "Is it greater?", followed by the result of the comparison (5 > -2)
print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2)

# Print the string "Is it greater or equal?", followed by the result of the comparison (5 >= -2)
print("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2)

# Print the string "Is it less or equal?", followed by the result of the comparison (5 <= -2)
print("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2)
```

2. Remember in Exercise 0 when you started python3.6? Start python3.6 this way again and, using the math operators, use Python as a calculator.

3. Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it.

4. Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so itâ€™s more accurate. 20.0 is floating point.
