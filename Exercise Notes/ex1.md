The first exercise was to create a program which executes the print function. I had to type a number of print commands using the various ways I could enclose strings, such as with; single quotes ('') and double quotes (""). Below is the code sample for the exercise

```python
ex1.py
 1     print("Hello World!")
 2     print("Hello Again")
 3     print("I like typing this.")
 4     print("This is fun.")
 5     print('Yay! Printing.')
 6     print("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
 7     print('I "said" do not touch this.')
```

## Study Drills

#### Make your script print another line.

```python
 1     print("Hello World!")
 2     print("Hello Again")
 3     print("I like typing this.")
 4     print("This is fun.")
 5     print('Yay! Printing.')
 6     print("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
 7     print('I "said" do not touch this.')
 8     print("Hello other line")
```

Added an additional print command on line 8 to make the script print another line

#### Make your script print only one of the lines.

```python
 1     print("Hello World!")
 2     """ print("Hello Again")
 3     print("I like typing this.")
 4     print("This is fun.")
 5     print('Yay! Printing.')
 6     print("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
 7     print('I "said" do not touch this.') """
```

Using the multi-line comment feature by adding triple quotes to all the lines except the first one I was able to print just the first line

#### Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.

- Putting a # character before the beginning of the line will "comment" out that line making sure that is not read by the complier.
